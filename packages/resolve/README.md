### Resolves modules in async way
The `resolve` function return a Promise with module's path and package.json contents
```js
import resolve from `@teku-blocks/resolve`

// {
//   path: string,
//   pkg: object
// }
const { path, pkg } = await resolve('moduleA')
```

### Resolves wildcard modules
For example, to resolve all modules belonging to [`@teku`](https://teku.asia) organization
```js
// {
//    '@teku/form': { path, pkg },
//    '@teku/react': { path, pkg },
//    '@teku/firebase': { path, pkg }
// }
const tekuModules = await resolveWildcard('@teku/*')
```

### Resolves modules using custom file contents filter
(Coming soon)
